# Reload Template Policy — Student Leave

> **Module:** ssi*school_student_leave\
> **Model:** `school_student_leave`\
> **Menu:** School > Student Activities > Student Leaves\
> **Actor:** administrator in group \_Settings / Technical Settings*\
> **Requires:** `01-create`

## Pre-Condition

- **Record:** None — usable regardless of status.
- **Config:** At least one active `policy.template` exists for this model, so a matching
  template can be found.
- **Access:** User is in group _Settings / Technical Settings_ (`base.group_system`).
  The **Policies** tab that contains this button is only visible to this group.

## Flow

1. Open the **School > Student Activities > Student Leaves** menu.
2. Open the record whose assigned policy template should be re-evaluated.
3. On the **Policies** tab, click **Reload Template Policy**.

## Post-Condition

- **Policy Template** is recomputed and re-assigned to the highest-sequence
  `policy.template` for this model whose condition currently matches the record. This
  may change which action buttons and policy fields (`confirm_ok`,
  `restart_approval_ok`, etc.) are granted, without changing the record's status.
